About

This is a mini project I have conceptualised to help learn the Django frame work, sharpen up on Statistical Analysis and to learn effective Data Visualisation. I am using public Pokemon datasets provided by on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/pokemon-sun-and-moon-gen-7-stats). To deal with the data on the server side I am using Pandas/Numpy and to visualise the data I am using DataTables, Charts.js and HighCharts.

The project is being developed continuously; for those who are interested the main action in the code, in my opinion, takes place in the following files:
    1) src --> charts --> views.py
    2) src --> templates --> charts.html

I will eventually tidy things up and take the javascript out of charts.html.
